				<h1>Education</h1>
				<h3>Recent Graduate from the University of St Andrews</h3>
				<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1%;">
					I graduated with a Master’s in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews in 2024, having focused on pure mathematics and the applications of computer programming to mathematical problems. My dissertation was entitled <a href="Diss.pdf" target="_blank">'A Walk along a Space-Filling Curve: Generating, Analysing, and Modeling Space-Filling Curves.'</a> I analyzed space-filling curves by encoding them using Python and generating graphical representations of approximations to the curves, alongside more traditional mathematical analysis.

				<h1>Coding</h1>
				<h3>Experienced Professional and Passionate Hobbyist</h3>
				<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1%;">
					<p>I have a wide variety of professional programming experience. Specifially, I have worked with Skyscraper Foundry for the last few years, analyzing New York City's vast zoning data and creating an AI-assisted predictive planning tool. I have also worked with M. Arch Architects on their zoning app, Zoner, using Ruby on Rails to create the structure of the application. I also spent the last summer working with a team from the University of St Andrews to create an internal sustainability web application. In these projects, I have used everything from Python to Javascript to SQL.</p>
					<p>I also enjoy working on personal programming projects. My game development work is explored further below, but on my own, I do the Advent of Code, l33tcode, and spend time developing my personal Linux computer.</p>

				<h1>Video Game Development</h1>
				<h3>Full Stack Game Development Team</h3>
				<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1%;">
					<p>I spend much of my free time working on video game development with SPRODSOFT, a team of three friends not counting myself. We have coded four games in the last three years: Box of Squingus (very well received!), Fishyfus of the Deep: Legend of the Eight Gems, Sprodkart, and Project Margrave.</p>
					<p>Each of these games involved full stack development and many opportunities to learn and apply new skills, languages, and engines. Through this work, I have improved my proficiency with C#, Godot, and Unity and learned about all different aspects of development, from back end to interface to 3D modeling.</p>

				<h3>Trained Coxswain and Crew Member with Competition Experience</h3>
				<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1%;">
					<p>I am an experienced coxswain and rower and love working outdoors! I've rowed with the <a href="https://villagecommunityboathouse.org/" target="_blank">Village Community Boathouse</a> for many years, rowing in their Sunday open sessions. I competed in high school with their youth crew, winning the <a href="https://old.villagecommunityboathouse.org/2019/03/snow-row-2019.html" target="_blank">2019 Snow Row</a>, the <a href="https://old.villagecommunityboathouse.org/2018/11/icebreaker-2018.html" target="_blank">2018 Icebreaker</a>, and the <a href="https://old.villagecommunityboathouse.org/2018/10/head-of-the-weir-2018.html" target="_blank">2018 Head of the Weir Race</a>. I also occasionally join the ultimate test of endurance: their annual <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230324224432/https://www.villagecommunityboathouse.org/2019-row-around-manhattan/" target="_blank">Row Around Manhattan</a>.</p>
					<p>I also often participate in their boatbuilding sessions, helping to craft the <a href="https://villagecommunityboathouse.org/our-fleet" target="_blank">historic Whitehall gigs and other boats</a> used by the VCB, specifically Zoë and Integrity.</p>

				<h3>Euphonium and other Brass Instruments</h3>
				<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1%;">
					<p>I have played the euphonium for twelve years, in concert, symphonic, jazz, and marching bands. I have also played the trombone and trumpet on occasion to expand my abilities. I also conducted Robert W. Smith's "The Maelstrom" with the University of St Andrews Wind Band.</p>
